# One Consensus

One Consensus is a simple, proof-of-concept project that explores how groups of people can pool resources and make decisions together using blockchain technology.

## Why does it exist?

Traditional crowdfunding and decision-making platforms rely on a central authority. One Consensus shows an alternative approach where the rules are baked into code and executed on a decentralized network, giving all participants equal visibility and control.

## How does it work?

One Consensus is a decentralized platform that allows groups of people to pool resources and make decisions together using blockchain technology. It works by creating a smart contract that enforces the rules of the platform and executes decisions on a decentralized network.

## What are the benefits?

One Consensus offers several benefits over traditional crowdfunding and decision-making platforms:

1. Decentralization: All participants have equal visibility and control over the platform, and decisions are executed on a decentralized network.
2. Transparency: All transactions and decisions are recorded on a blockchain, making it transparent and tamper-proof.
3. Security: The platform is built on top of blockchain technology, which is known for its security and immutability.
